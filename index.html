            <p id="apologyText">Kuhle, I want to sincerely apologize for my behavior yesterday. I recognize that my attitude was completely unjustified, and I deeply regret how I responded to you. I let my insecurities and thoughts cloud my judgment, causing me to overlook your feelings and the validity of your response to my concerns. I am truly sorry for being so inconsiderate and for not treating you with the respect you deserve.

                I understand if you need time and space after how I acted, and I donâ€™t expect you to forgive me right away or want to talk to me soon. But I genuinely hope that one day, when you feel ready, you might reach out and allow me the chance to make things right.</p>
